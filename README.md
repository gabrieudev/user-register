## Introduction

The goal of this project is to provide a complete system, from the backend, built with Java and Spring Boot, to the frontend, developed in React with Vite, that allows for user registration.

The system will register users in memory using the H2 database and display them on screen in real time, also allowing the deletion of these users.

## Features

- View registered users.
- Register users.
- Delete users.
- Detailed error messages for issues such as invalid fields, duplicate emails, etc.
